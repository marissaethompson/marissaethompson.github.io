My research examines the processes that produce racial and socioeconomic inequality: the interplay between academic inequality and segregation in educational contexts, the ways that individual choices shape aggregate patterns of segregation, and how boundaries between social groups are maintained and negotiated. My work not only seeks to understand our most pressing social problems but also to identify policies and practices to reduce inequality. My research has been published in journals such as <i>Social Forces</i>, <i>Sociology of Education</i>, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, and the <i>American Education Research Journal</i>, among others. It has been supported by generous funding from the Russell Sage Foundation, the Gates Foundation, the National Academy of Education, the Spencer Foundation, and the Institute of Education Sciences. 
 
The first strand of my research focuses on inequality and segregation in educational contexts. I am particularly interested in how preferences and decision-making patterns shape aggregate patterns of segregation. Though individuals are tasked with making educational decisions – such as to send their child to a certain school or to declare a specific major – in individual contexts, these decisions have cumulative consequences for the demographic makeup of a community’s schools, a university’s major, or an entire occupation. Forthcoming work in this vein examines how parents of school-aged children choose a school for their child. Here, I leverage a series of novel survey experiments to explore how status competition and boundary maintenance shape parental engagement with ranked educational data, such as the information one might find on <i>GreatSchools.org</i>. Further, a [recent article](https://academic.oup.com/sf/advance-article/doi/10.1093/sf/soad110/7252817?utm_source=authortollfreelink&utm_campaign=sf&utm_medium=email&guestAccessKey=d1e2eb36-ec6f-4a90-9009-0f35b2201128){:target="_blank"} examines the sources of the Black gender gap in educational attainment, with a focus on understanding the role of punishment in shaping inequality over the life course. Finally, some of my ongoing experimental work examines how individuals make normative judgments about fairness, equity, and merit in the context of persistently unequal schooling. 
 
Further, my research agenda also interrogates the emergence of racial/ethnic categories themselves and how people draw boundaries between “us” and “them”. For example, [ongoing work](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8tnrk/){:target="_blank"} examines how genetic ancestry tests (such as those available commercially through <i>23andMe</i> and <i>Ancestry.com</i>) affect the boundary-making processes of Black Americans as they grapple with their perceptions of who is – and isn’t – Black. Further, drawing from the case of the revision of official racial/ethnic categories on the upcoming 2030 U.S. census, I am currently investigating how everyday Americans appeal for categorical recognition and frame their perceptions of contemporary and historical racial boundaries. This work advances theoretical understandings of the racial classification logics that shape the racial structure of the U.S. and addresses key social and policy questions, including debates over who should be eligible to benefit from policies such as affirmative action and reparations.
